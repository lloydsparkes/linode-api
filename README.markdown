#Linode C# Api

Written as a Asynchronous Portable Class Library - as I am working on a WP7 and Windows 8 Metro App for Linode.

It is designed to be very simple, so is just Objects and Static Method Calls which perform the API Calls.

Should work across:

+ WP7 / WP7.5 / WP8
+ Silverlight 
+ Asp.Net/.Net
+ Metro Style Apps

##Current Progress
All the Current API Calls are implemented - but are untested - I need to think of a way to properly test this code - some sort of test harness I think

Please let me know of any issues / improvements I could make.

I got Inspiration from [Austin.Linode](https://github.com/AustinWise/Austin.Linode)'s Project
